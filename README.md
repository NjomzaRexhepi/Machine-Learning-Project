This repository contains the semestral project for the Machine Learning course, focusing on data related to imports in Kosovo for the years 2023-2024.
Data Source: https://dogana.rks-gov.net/OpenData/Index?id=4

# Project Phases
Phase 1: Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.
Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection.

# Phase 2: Model Training
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Apply machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.).
Model evaluation and performance metrics.

# Phase 3: Model Retraining
Retraining models with updated data or improved hyperparameters.
Fine-tuning models for better accuracy and generalization.
Continuous evaluation and testing for model robustness.
